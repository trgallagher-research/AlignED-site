          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The ACARA Comparative Judgement benchmark tests whether AI systems can accurately compare pairs of student work samples against Australian Curriculum achievement standards. Unlike the other AlignED benchmarks, which test knowledge recall and reasoning, this benchmark tests applied assessment judgement: determining which of two student work samples better meets a given curriculum standard.</p>

          <h2>What It Measures</h2>
          <p>This benchmark answers a specific question: <strong>Can LLMs accurately compare student work against curriculum standards?</strong> This is a foundational skill for any AI system used to support assessment in schools.</p>

          <p>Each evaluation presents the model with two student work samples and asks which one better demonstrates achievement at a given curriculum standard level. The model must make a binary choice (Sample A or Sample B), and this choice is compared against the verified correct answer from the ACARA work sample database.</p>

          <h2>Source</h2>
          <p>The benchmark uses 79 verified comparative pairs derived from the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) work sample portfolios. These portfolios contain annotated examples of student work at different achievement levels, providing a ground truth for comparison.</p>

          <p>Each pair consists of two student work samples at different achievement levels for the same curriculum area, making the correct answer objectively verifiable.</p>

          <h2>Method</h2>
          <p>Each of the 79 pairs is presented to the model in two orientations:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Forward:</strong> Sample A vs Sample B (as originally ordered)</li>
            <li><strong>Reverse:</strong> Sample B vs Sample A (swapped presentation order)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This position-swap design serves two purposes:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>It tests whether the model's judgement is influenced by presentation order (position bias)</li>
            <li>It provides a built-in reliability measure through position-swap scoring</li>
          </ol>

          <p>Each orientation is evaluated 3 times (trials), yielding 237 total evaluations per model (79 pairs &times; 2 orientations &times; ~1.5 due to trial structure).</p>

          <h2>Scoring</h2>
          <p>Two metrics are reported for each model:</p>

          <table>
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th>Metric</th>
                <th>Description</th>
                <th>Range</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Accuracy</strong></td>
                <td>Percentage of pairs where the model chose the correct (higher-achieving) work sample</td>
                <td>0&ndash;100%</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td><strong>Reliability</strong></td>
                <td>Percentage of pairs where the model gave the same answer regardless of presentation order (forward vs reverse). This is a test-retest reliability measure.</td>
                <td>0&ndash;100%</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>High accuracy with low reliability suggests the model is getting answers right by chance in some orientations. High reliability with low accuracy would indicate a systematic but incorrect judgement strategy. The ideal is high scores on both metrics.</p>

          <h2>Reliability</h2>
          <p>The position-swap reliability score serves as built-in reliability evidence. A model that gives the same answer regardless of whether Sample A or Sample B is presented first demonstrates stable judgement rather than position-dependent responses.</p>

          <h2>Excluded Models</h2>
          <p>Four models were excluded from the ACARA results due to invalid response formats (0% accuracy from inability to produce valid judgements):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>DeepSeek R1</li>
            <li>Gemini 3 Pro</li>
            <li>GPT-5.2</li>
            <li>GPT-5 Mini</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Prompt templates</h2>
          <p>Two prompt templates are used for the ACARA benchmarks.</p>

          <h3>Comparative judgement (CJ)</h3>
          <p>Each pair is presented as a single user message with no system prompt. Template variables are filled from the ACARA work sample database.</p>

          <pre><code>You are an expert educational assessor evaluating student work against the Australian Curriculum achievement standard for {year_level} English.

### Achievement Standard
{achievement_standard}

### Task
{task_description}

Compare the following two student work samples and determine which one better demonstrates the achievement standard.

### Sample A
{sample_a}

### Sample B
{sample_b}

Which sample better demonstrates the achievement standard?
Respond with ONLY one of these two options:
BETTER_SAMPLE: A
or
BETTER_SAMPLE: B</code></pre>

          <h3>Standards-based grading (SG)</h3>
          <p>Each work sample is presented individually for absolute classification against the achievement standard.</p>

          <pre><code>You are an experienced teacher assessing student work against the Australian
Curriculum achievement standard.

## Subject and Year Level
{subject} — {year_level}

## Achievement Standard
{achievement_standard}

## Task
{task_description}

## Student Work
{student_work_content}

## Your Task

The achievement standard above describes what a student working AT the
expected level should demonstrate. Based on the evidence in this student's
work, classify it as:

- ABOVE_SATISFACTORY: Consistently goes beyond what the standard describes.
- SATISFACTORY: Demonstrates what the standard describes.
- BELOW_SATISFACTORY: Does not yet demonstrate what the standard describes.

Respond in exactly this format and nothing else:

CLASSIFICATION: [ABOVE_SATISFACTORY / SATISFACTORY / BELOW_SATISFACTORY]
REASONING: [one sentence]</code></pre>

          <p>No additional instructions are provided to the model for either prompt.</p>

          <h2>Key Findings</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Top accuracy is 86.5% (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Llama 3.3 70B), suggesting this is a challenging task even for frontier models</li>
            <li>GPT-5 achieved the highest reliability (94.1%) despite not having the highest accuracy (83.5%), indicating very stable but slightly less accurate judgements</li>
            <li>Several reasoning-focused models (o3, Claude 4 Sonnet) show high reliability (92%), suggesting deliberate reasoning improves judgement stability</li>
            <li>Gemini 3 Flash shows a notable accuracy-reliability gap (81.0% accuracy, 68.8% reliability), indicating position-dependent responses</li>
          </ul>
