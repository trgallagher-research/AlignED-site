          <h2>What is educational alignment?</h2>
          <p>When AI helps students learn, writes lesson plans, or gives teaching advice, it needs to know what good teaching looks like — according to research, not popular belief. Educational alignment means an AI's responses match what decades of educational research has established. AlignED measures this.</p>

          <h2>Why it matters</h2>
          <p>Many beliefs about learning — learning styles, left brain/right brain, "we only use 10% of our brains" — are myths. About half of teachers believe them. If AI perpetuates these misconceptions, it does harm. If AI knows better than these myths, and can explain why teaching strategies fail in practice, it becomes a genuinely useful tool.</p>

          <h2>Who should care</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Teachers and school leaders</strong> — Choosing which AI tools to trust in classrooms</li>
            <li><strong>Policymakers</strong> — Writing guidelines for AI in education</li>
            <li><strong>EdTech developers</strong> — Understanding where their models have blind spots</li>
            <li><strong>Researchers</strong> — Transparent, reproducible benchmarks for study</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What AlignED tests</h2>
          <p>AlignED evaluates AI across four areas of educational knowledge:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Brain science</strong> — Can AI separate myths from facts about how people learn? (32 items)</li>
            <li><strong>Classroom reasoning</strong> — Can AI diagnose why good teaching strategies sometimes fail? (12 scenarios)</li>
            <li><strong>Teaching knowledge</strong> — Does AI know what certified teachers are expected to know? (1,143 items)</li>
            <li><strong>Student work judgement</strong> — Can AI accurately compare student work against curriculum standards? (79 pairs, reported separately)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The first three combine into a composite score. See <a href="methodology/">Methodology</a> for full details.</p>

          <h2>What we claim and don't claim</h2>
          <p>AlignED tests how well AI responses align with evidence-based educational research. Our benchmarks adapt peer-reviewed instruments for AI evaluation.</p>

          <div class="note">
            <p><strong>What we do not claim:</strong> Benchmark performance does not prove "understanding" or predict real-world tutoring effectiveness. High scores indicate alignment with research evidence, not certification for deployment.</p>
