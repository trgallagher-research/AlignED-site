        <p class="subtitle">The case for evaluating AI alignment with educational research</p>

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>AI systems are increasingly deployed in educational settings&mdash;as tutors, teaching assistants, and content generators. Yet these systems may reinforce educational misconceptions that persist despite decades of research debunking them.</p>

          <p>Consider neuromyths: false beliefs about the brain and learning that remain widespread among educators. Research consistently shows that around 50% of teachers believe claims like "we only use 10% of our brains" or "students learn best when taught in their preferred learning style." When AI systems perpetuate these misconceptions, they risk entrenching them further.</p>

          <h2>What Makes AlignED Different</h2>
          <p>Standard AI benchmarks test academic content&mdash;mathematics, coding, general knowledge. AlignED tests something different: alignment with evidence-based educational research.</p>

          <p>We focus on what teachers need to know, not what students should learn:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Misconception rejection:</strong> Can the model identify and reject neuromyths with appropriate confidence?</li>
            <li><strong>Diagnostic reasoning:</strong> When evidence-based strategies fail in practice, can the model explain why?</li>
            <li><strong>Pedagogical knowledge:</strong> Does the model demonstrate cross-domain teaching expertise?</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Beyond Accuracy</h2>
          <p>A model that scores 90% on a benchmark under ideal conditions may perform very differently in practice. AlignED examines multiple dimensions:</p>

          <div class="grid grid-2 mt-3 mb-3">
            <div class="card">
              <h4>Temperature Robustness</h4>
              <p>How stable is performance across different temperature settings? A model that only performs well at T=0 may be brittle.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h4>Prompt Sensitivity</h4>
              <p>Does rephrasing questions change answers? We test standard, interrogative, embedded, and adversarial framings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h4>Confidence Calibration</h4>
              <p>Are models appropriately uncertain when they should be? Overconfidence in wrong answers is particularly problematic in education.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="card">
              <h4>Token Efficiency</h4>
              <p>How much reasoning does the model require? Efficiency matters for real-world deployment.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Grounded in Research</h2>
          <p>AlignED benchmarks are adapted from peer-reviewed instruments and validated assessments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Neuromyths Survey:</strong> Adapted from Dekker et al. (2012), the foundational study documenting neuromyth prevalence among teachers</li>
            <li><strong>Implementation Scenarios:</strong> Developed from research on why evidence-based practices fail in real classrooms</li>
            <li><strong>Pedagogical Knowledge:</strong> Based on validated teacher certification assessments</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Who This Is For</h2>

          <h3>Policymakers and Governance Bodies</h3>
          <p>AI governance requires transparent evaluation. AlignED provides standardised benchmarks that can inform deployment decisions, procurement guidelines, and regulatory frameworks.</p>

          <h3>Educational Researchers</h3>
          <p>AlignED offers a framework for evaluating AI educational capabilities with open methodology and reproducible results. The platform supports both model comparison and longitudinal tracking.</p>

          <h3>AI Developers</h3>
          <p>AlignED tests capabilities that standard benchmarks miss. Understanding where models succeed or fail on educational knowledge can guide training and development priorities.</p>

          <h2>What We Can Claim</h2>
          <p>AlignED tests how well AI responses align with evidence-based educational research. Our benchmarks adapt peer-reviewed instruments for AI evaluation.</p>

          <div class="note">
            <p><strong>What we do not claim:</strong> Benchmark performance does not prove "understanding" or predict real-world tutoring effectiveness. High scores indicate alignment with research evidence, not certification for deployment.</p>
          </div>

          <h2>The Educational Alignment Index</h2>
          <p>The Educational Alignment Index (EAI) is our composite score, combining performance across all benchmarks and evaluation dimensions. It provides a single metric for comparing models while maintaining transparency about component scores.</p>

          <p>See our <a href="methodology/scoring.html">scoring methodology</a> for details on how the EAI is calculated.</p>
